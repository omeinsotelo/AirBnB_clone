# Requirements

## Python Scripts


- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7 or more)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')``
- All your classes should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')```
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')```

## Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start by test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
- e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- All your modules should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')```
- All your classes should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')```
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')```
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case
